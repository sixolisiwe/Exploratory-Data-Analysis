○ what the purpose of the project is,
The purpose of the project is to select a dataset and create a report as described in this task.
Below are specific instructions for the task.

You are free to choose any dataset of your choice to analyse. Here are some sources
of datasets:
● United Nations datasets
● South African Open Data
● World Bank Data
Your report should include the following:
● A brief description of the dataset you have chosen
● A description of how your dataset was cleaned
● A description of how you managed missing data
● A detailed description of your findings accompanied by appropriate
visualisations
● A wide selection of appropriate data visualisations. Besides Matplotlib, we
encourage you to explore and use libraries other than with more interesting
visualisations


○ what data is being analysed (add links to the datasets if appropriate),
I chose a dataset from the South African Open Data. 
The data set I worked with for this task is called the 2016 matric school report as linked below.
