○ what the purpose of the project is,
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is a crucial component of data science which allows one to understand the basics of what your data looks like and what kinds of questions might be answered by them. For this task, we are going to clean, sanitise and explore our data. Using the movies dataset to answer some of the data questions found in the notebook by writing code in the cells.


○ what data is being analysed (add links to the datasets if appropriate),
The movies data set.
Then the automobile data set



○ how the data is being analysed (add links to .ipynb files if
appropriate) and

Both the data sets are being analysed using  pandas, numpy and matplotlib 

○ what the main findings are (add links to report documents where
appropriate)
Below is a brief overview of the automobile dataset.
Data points include 2014_pass_rate, 2014_achieved, 2014_wrote, 2013_pass_rate,2013_achieved,2013_wrote, 2012_pass_rate, 2012_achieved, 2012_wrote. The notebook is divided into three main sections Data Cleaning and Preparation, Data Exploration and Visualization, Questions and answers and ending with Summary and Conclusion.
